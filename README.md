# 🏆 Competitive Programming 

This repository contains my solutions and practice code for **Competitive Programming**.  
It includes problems from platforms like **Codeforces, CSES, and custom practice sets**.  
The code is primarily written in **C++ (with STL)**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 🔹 BestProblems
Handpicked problems that are tricky, unique, or useful for revision.  

---

### 🔹 CodeForces
Solutions from **Codeforces contests and practice problems**.  
- **BinarySearch** → Problems solved using binary search techniques  
- **Contests** → Contest-wise solutions (Div. 2, Div. 3, etc.)  
- **Problems** → Individual Codeforces problem solutions
